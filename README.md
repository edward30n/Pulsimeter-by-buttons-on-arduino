# Pulsimeter-by-buttons-on-arduino
Purpose:

* The objective to carry out this project is to create a system which analyzes and delivers the heart pulse of our patient or subject to be treated. For its realization it was decided to carry it out through ARDUINO (it is a printed board with the necessary components for the microcontroller to work and its communication with a computer through serial communication).
* The construction of the system was carried out by means of a simulator and then the implementation was carried out in order to have a guide with the adequate operation, for a better solution of the project. The code was also made and tested in both the simulator and the ADUINO environment.
* To obtain the result of beats per minute, the patient must press a push-button (button) and, referring to this, the ARDUINO will print the result by means of the LED screen.
